Logan and I started out the day around 7:30 by loading into my truck and heading out on the drive to Glacier.

One of the “luxuries” I like to take on the trail is a Mountain House freeze dried ice cream sandwich. Apparently Mountain House cannot keep up with demand so we couldn’t find the ice cream sandwiches anywhere near us. On the way to Glacier we stopped in Kalispell and the local Walmart had enough for Logan and I to both pick a sandwich up.

After the stop in Kalispell we headed into Glacier to pick up our backcountry permit. Since we had an advance reservation we didn’t need to do anything besides listen to a quick safety talk as we picked up the permit. We spent a short bit of time walking along a trail near the visitor center to enjoy some flat, backpack free trail.

Once we finished in the park we headed to the West Glacier KOA a few miles away. We had a tent site reserved to spend the night at before starting our hike the next day. Finding campsites in Glacier can be quite challenging so we opt for the KOA as it is a nice campground and is only a few miles from the park.

For our “last supper” we started out with ice cream and then moved onto to the main meal. The KOA has a restaurant on site where Logan had half of a BBQ chicken with a side of smoked mac and cheese while I had a delicious pulled pork sandwich and a side of smoked mac and cheese. We were both stuffed and happy — a good way to end dinner the night before we started hiking.

After dinner we wrapped things up and relaxed by attending a knife forging demonstration at the KOA. We also started on our book for the trip: _Deep Country: Five Years in the Welsh Hills_ by Neil Ansell. We like to take a book along as an evening activity at our campsite.

After everything we crawled into our tent around 8:30 so we could settle down and sleep. However, it was a little hard to sleep due to the excitement we had for the next day.
