Back in May of 2015 I took a trip out to Yoesmite and backpacked for 5 days and over 50 miles. Yosemite was cold and wet around that time of the year, but that did not deter me from having a good time. I saw some amazing sites, and I got to see the park with snow â€” something that not everyone gets to experience. Below are photos as well as a video of the trip.
