Living in Montana means having an endless wishlist of backpacking trips. One such trip is backpacking in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, often referred to as the Beartooths. The pinnacle of the area is a trail called “The Beaten Path,” spanning roughly 26 miles point-to-point across the wilderness. In 2023, Logan and I had the opportunity to hike through the Beartooths, with our route including The Beaten Path. It was one of my favorite backpacking trips ever, and I'm eager to return to the area soon.

As usual, I journaled each day and took many pictures. Over the next couple of weeks, I’ll be posting each day of my journal from the trip along with corresponding pictures. In this post, I've included two of my favorite pictures from the trip. While I don’t believe blog posts and pictures can truly capture the essence of the experience, I hope my posts and pictures provide a glimpse into the adventure we had.
